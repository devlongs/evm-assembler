# EVM-Assembler
EVM-Assembler is a lightweight, custom-built assembler for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It provides a low-level interface for writing and converting assembly-like instructions into EVM bytecode. This project was developed as a tool to explore the inner workings of the EVM and experiment with bytecode generation.


### Experimentation:
This assembler is ideal for testing new ideas, writing minimal smart contracts, and exploring EVM instructions that are not typically used in high-level languages like Solidity or Vyper.


### Key Features
- Converts assembly-like code into EVM bytecode.
- Supports parsing of standard EVM opcodes, macros, and label-based jumps.
- Designed with a modular structure to facilitate future experimentation and customization.
- Command-line interface for assembling code from files.
